    "About Me": "Hi, my name is Ayush Gairola. I started my journey in civil engineering, but soon realized that building something of my own required a different set of resources and skills. Transitioning to web development allowed me to create, share, and improve projects that can help others while offering the potential of monetization if executed well. I am passionate about open source because it brings together like-minded individuals who contribute their ideas and skills to make each project better every day. My background in engineering instilled a strong problem-solving mindset that I continuously apply to my current work, and I'm excited about what the future holds as I build innovative solutions."
